we learned very basics that are needed to start learning C++.
Concepts like:
  1. Introduction to programing and Programing Languages.
  2. What is Machine Language
  3. What is Assembly Language
  4. What is a Low Level Language
  5. What is High Level Language
  6. What are Compiler Based Languages
  7. What are Interpreter Based Languages
  8. Intoduction to C++
  9. Intoduction to C++ Development - We learned(theoratically) how to develop a C++ Program
  10. Intoduction to Compiler, Linker, and Libraries
  11. Installing and Integrating IDE - Those who know me know that I am a VIM Developer!
  12. We comipled our first C++ program - Iconic Hello World Program.
  13. Few Common C++ Problems.
  14. Configure your compiler - Build Configuration
  15. Configure your compiler - Compiler Extension
  16. Configure your compiler - Warning and Error Levels
  17. Configure your compiler - Choosing a Language Standard
  18. What Language standard is my compiler using?

Someone with ~11 Years of experience I already knew about these topics but it was good to brush up on concepts.
We also compiled HelloWorld.cpp and CompilerStandard.cpp.
